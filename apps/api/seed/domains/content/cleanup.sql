-- Every content table is event-scoped, so every statement here resolves the same set — the events
-- of the seeded organizations, which is what `events-cleanup.sql` deletes — and the ordering is
-- unchanged: children before the `speaker_profiles` and `content_sessions` they reference, all of
-- them before the events cleanup further down.
